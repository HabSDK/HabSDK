# HabSDK
Designing the optimal Mars habitat is a huge task, beyond the ability of any single team. Hab SDK is a crowdsourcing design tool, allowing millions of global users to compete and collaborate to come up with the best possible design

##About the project
When setting up a habitat on Mars, there are a huge number of variables which need to be balanced to produce the optimal environment. These include both human parameters, such as comfort or ease-of access, and logistical parameters, such as ease-of-assembly or total weight to be transported.

Designing the best possible Mars habitat is a huge task, beyond the ability of any one team. Hab SDK is a crowdsourcing design tool, allowing millions of global users to compete and collaborate to come up with the best possible design.

Users create their design by inserting and placing everything required for the habitat's operation, from utilities to scientific tools. Designs are automatically analysed across a wide variety of metrics, reflecting their suitability for use on Mars. An online leaderboard allows for individual designers to see how their designs compare to others, and for the designs with the best scores to be selected for building on Earth or Mars.

Hab SDK is written in Javascript, utilising the Phaser HTML5 framework, enabling it to be run directly from the user's browser. The client side runs the visualisations and allows the user to create their optimal design, while the server side runs the metrics, analysis and scoring.

All the 3D models used in the project were generated using Sketchup, and converted into isometric sprites using Blender.

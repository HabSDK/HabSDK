HabSDK is a game we created to crowdsource the design and evaluation of 
long-duration space habitats. The user can design and evaluate their concept
against a set of metrics including power consumption, weight and other human 
factors.
15 Seconds
All designs are submitted to a server and ranked to find the best solution.
We're currently improving our metrics and our component library to create a
great design, evaluation and education game.

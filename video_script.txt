HabSDK is a game we created to crowdsource the design and evaluation of 
long-duration space habitats. The user can design and evaluate their concept
against a set of metrics including power consumption, weight and other human 
factors.
15 Seconds
All designs are submitted to a server and ranked to find the best solution.
We're currently improving our metrics and our component library to create a
great design, evaluation and education game.

HabSKD is a design tool and crowdsourcing game for designing habitation
environments for extended durations in space. We wanted to make it easy to 
design layouts and evaluate them against a set of metrics such as 
accessability, power consumption and other human factors. 

Once a player has designed their ideal layout with guidance from the game,
they can submit it to the server which ranks the best designs.
We're adding many more component types and useful metrics to use it
both for design and also as a fun outreach and education tool.

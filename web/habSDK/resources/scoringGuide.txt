TIPS FOR SCORING:

Try to create the most suitable space for the habitat on Mars. Points will be allocated for adding the optimal amount of items required for the colonists.
Essential items will score more points (for example, adding toilets).

Placement of the items matters.
Points will be given to items that are placed on obvious locations (eg, walls on corners). Points are also given based on proximity (eg, placing fire-extinguishers near incinerators, and keeping kitchen equipment close to one another).

Points are available for using common sense (eg, adding enough hygiene facilities and medical equipment, or avoiding blocking any entrances).

Keeping the colonists happy is a great way to add to your score. If you solution ends up raising or maintaining the colonists' satisfaction level, then you will receive a points boost. (eg, keeping a balance between essential items and open space)
